# Binary Video Compression Prototype

This repository contains a Python prototype of a binary video compression algorithm developed for a research project. The algorithm converts input files to binary using a custom encoding technique and generates frames for a black and white video. Black dots represent 1's and white dots represent 0's in the resulting video.

### **Note**:- {Future Plan}: make the code more effective. Use of [**C++**].

## Usage

To use the compression algorithm, run `compress.py` with the input file to compress. This generates a compressed binary file and a corresponding video file. To decompress the compressed file, run `decompress.py` with the compressed binary file. The script generates a decompressed file that matches the original input file. A `play.py` script is included for playing back the resulting videos.

## Dependencies

The prototype requires Python 3.6 or higher and the following dependencies:

- NumPy: for array manipulation
- OpenCV: for video encoding and decoding
- tqdm: for progress bar visualization
